            <td class="schedule-description">We present two findings on how environmental policy uncertainty impacts municipal bond returns. First, returns increase after a new pollution standard is proposed but decrease after this standard is  finalized. Second, after annual announcements of compliance status, returns fall for counties that remain in compliance but increase for newly noncompliant counties. We present suggestive evidence linking these short-run market reactions to long-run changes in pollution and housing prices. Our  findings suggest that increases in either regulatory stringency or uncertainty over future environmental policy increase the cost of municipal debt raised to fund critical infrastructure.</td>

              Ideology, Incidence and the Political Economy of Fuel Taxes: Evidence from the California 2018 Proposition 6 <br><br>

            </td>
            <td class="schedule-description">In the 2018 midterm election, California voters rejected Proposition 6, a ballot initiative that sought to repeal state gasoline taxes and vehicle fees enacted as part of the 2017 Road Repair and Accountability Act.  We study the relationship between support for the proposition, political ideology and the economic benefits of the repeal at the census tract level.  We find that both ideology and economic factors help to explain voter behavior.  Every hundred dollars of annual per-household costs imposed by the Road Repair and Accountability Act increased support for proposition by 3 - 9 percentage points, roughly comparable to a commensurate increase in the share of &#39;liberal&#39; voters.  Notably, we find that the relationship between the economic burden of the policy and popular opposition is much stronger for conservative areas than liberal areas, consistent with conservative proponents&#39; framing of the vote as one to &#39;repeal the gas tax.&#39;&#39; The relationship between response and ideology has important political economy implications as conservative areas tend to bear a higher burden from transportation taxes, as well as dedicate a higher fraction of household expenditures to transportation fuels and energy utilities.</td>

              Where There Is Smoke, There Are Movers: Climate Adaption in Response to Wildfire Smoke <br><br>
              <span class="speakers-name">Christopher Knittel</span><br>
            
            </td>
            <td class="schedule-description">In this study, we focus on indirect costs of wildfires that have yet to be studied: the economic consequences of households relocating because of wildfire smoke. Specifically, we estimate the causal effect of wildfire smoke on individuals&#39; decision to relocate to a different county, either within California or out of the state. Based on these estimates we calculate plausible total moving costs and loss of state revenue from people choosing to relocate due to wildfire smoke. This is the first study to investigate migration caused by wildfire smoke and the first study to empirically examine pollution-induced migration in the United States. To analyze migration responses from wildfire smoke, we leverage IRS tax records data from 2006-2019. These data track the annual movement of individuals and households from one county to another, and the average income of movers and stayers. We link these data to information on wildfire smoke concentration and a rich set of control variables. We employ a fixed-effects regression approach, which effectively controls for the mean migration level and wildfire smoke concentration in each county throughout the study period. Thus, our estimates quantify how much a county&#39;s migration level changes from one year to the next based on the change in the county&#39;s wildfire smoke concentration. We employ two different specifications of our regression model. First, we analyze the county-level total migration by regressing the annual inflow and outflow of people, as well as net migration on annual average wildfire smoke concentration. Second, to better understand whether people move to places with a lower wildfire smoke concentration, we turn to the county-pairs level. For each county combination, we estimate how smoke in the origin and in the destination county affects the number of relocations between the two counties. To ensure that we only capture the effect of wildfire smoke and not destroyed properties from wildfires, we control for the number of wildfire-affected houses.</td>

            <td class="schedule-description">Complementarities play a key role in the demand for many products, and accessories to existing products can influence demand for the original product. This study examines complementarities in the demand for rooftop solar and an accessory, battery energy storage. Using nationwide administrative data, we estimate a nested logit dynamic discrete choice model of solar and storage adoption. We quantify the demand complementarity between solar and storage, and find that if storage was not available, 20% of the coadoptions would not adopt anything. Further, power outages affect the demand for coadopting solar and storage, with the strongest effect in California.</td>

            <td class="schedule-description">We develop a spatial equilibrium model to evaluate the efficiency and distributional impacts of the leading air quality regulation in the United States: the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS). We link our economic model to an integrated assessment model for air pollutants which allows us to capture endogenous changes in emissions, amenities, labor, and production. Our results show that the NAAQS generate over $23 billion of annual welfare gains. This is roughly 80 percent of welfare gains of the second-best NAAQS design, but only 25 percent of the first-best emission pricing policy. The NAAQS benefits are concentrated in a small set of cities, impose substantial costs on manufacturing workers, improve amenities in counties in compliance with the NAAQS, and reduce emissions in compliance counties through general equilibrium channels. These findings highlight the importance of accounting for geographic reallocation and equilibrium responses when quantifying the effects of environmental regulation.</td>
